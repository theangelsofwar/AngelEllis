# AngelEllis
Embark a Modern Day Ellis and Angel Island- an Immigration Connection App. We The People Of The United States, in order to form a more Perfect Union, Choose You! Join the U.S.A.




In Modern Society, we have taken for granted what it means to be American. We have forgotten the reason, taken fro granted the reason our ancestors have taken the journey to become an American. 

Well this changes today. 

Based off of one of my favorite books growing up, The Arrival by Shaun Tan, encapsulating the immigration journey through images and art. 

America the beautiful, America the Free.


Made to work on the Ipod Shuffle 2006 only. Made in America.
